Two shortcuts are used:
     NOTE: these shortcuts use the notes app, so it's necessary to have two notes specifically prepared for these
           along with a sharing link linking to a word folder to store this information

TL;DR: -Make 2 notes along with a word folder with a word document in it 
       -Shortcut 1 gathers all info collected using screenshots. Screenshot only the instagram notifications that have "reel" or "post"
       on them and run the shortcut. Stores it in a note in notes app
       -Open your word folder, click on share, and copy a link. Paste it on the other note
       -Shortcut 2 copies info from your note in notes app and shares it to the word folder. Open your word document and paste it
       -Clear the contents (minus the note name) on the note used for shortcut 1 after using shortcut 2

Create the note in which you want to store your data
A main shortcut that extracts the data from screenshots. It retrieves the last screenshot saved on your phone and extracts all text on it
and stores it into a specific note in the notes app along with the date in which the screenshot was taken. This is to ensure all reels have a
date attributed to them to then be able to plot it in a graph. The screenshot will only be used if it contains the word reel or post in it
Do this for every screenshot that has an instagram notification in it.

IMPORTANT NOTE: you need to REMOVE instagram notifications that are simply text messages BEFORE SCREENSHOTTING. Keeping them would affect the
program counting reels. Theres nothing to account for these notifications.

Create a word folder with a document in it to store all data from the first shortcut. In the folder, click on share and "copy link" 
Paste the shared link in your second note

A secondary shortcut to make it very easy and fast to update the document with all data obtained from the first shortcut. It'll open the
note that contains all information extracted with the first shortcut and copy it to the clipboard. It'll open the note with the sharing link
and click it to take you to word. Click on the word document in which you want to store your data and paste the information 

IMPORTANT NOTE: you need to CLEAR THE INFO collected from the SCREENSHOT(S) AFTER using the shortcut in order to update your document
correctly. Otherwise it'd be adding the same information over and over

Optional: Make the secondary shortcut automatically run every day using automation on the Shortcuts app
